How to run the test
- run the command, `npm run test` or `npm test` or `npm t`

After running the command, few options will be displayed where with the help of one option you can filter specific file and run the test for that particular file.
- `Press p to filter by a filename regex pattern`
- You can type file name like 01, 02, 03 
- All the test files are in test folder which will give you clear idea on what files are available to test.
- You can make use of arrow keys to run select the options.

In each test files, one need to comment down importing files from final folder and enable files from exercise. For eg:
```js
// import App from '../final/05'
import App from '../exercise/05'
```
Reason to do so is we don't want final completed test to be run on local set-up, instead run exercise one.
